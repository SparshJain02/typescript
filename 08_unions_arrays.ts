// unions with arrays

const arr:string[] | number[] = [1,2,3,4]
// ??? is this correct nah it's not this type of syntax means either all of the strings or all of the numbers 

const brr: (string | number)[] = ["sparsh",7283,"bca5a"] 
// yep that's the right way

// this is something unique
const pi:3.14 = 3.14; // we can do like this also
